To see live logs of container
docker logs -f <containre name/id>

To mount the host path in container
docker run -d -v host_path:container_path <image name>

docker run -d --name c2 -v "$(pwd)/data:/containerData" -p 4040:80 static-web-app:v1
as metion above , docker need absolute host

to provide docker variable at run time
docker run -d -e DB_NAME=value <image_name>
docker run -d -e DB_URL=http://localhost:3306 --name c1 -p 7070:80 static-web-app:v1

docker-compose up -d --build 

and to remove any orphans container use blow command
docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans

To work with docker image we can use belwo utility called skopeo
skopeo is a command line utility that performs various operations on container images and image repositories.
skopeo does not require the user to be running as root to do most of its operations.
skopeo does not require a daemon to be running to perform its operations.
skopeo can work with OCI images as well as the original Docker v2 images.
